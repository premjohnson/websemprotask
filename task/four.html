        I am currently expanding my expertise in React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript by working on various projects. I recently completed a Power BI data analytics webinar, which enhanced my ability to visualize and interpret data for business purposes. I believe continuous learning is key to staying relevant in this ever-evolving tech industry.

    <h1>This is an H1 Heading</h1>
    <p><strong>Best suited for:</strong> The main title of the webpage, such as the name of a blog, article, or webpage topic. Use this sparingly, as there should typically only be one `<h1>` per page for the most important title.</p>

    <h2>This is an H2 Heading</h2>
    <p><strong>Best suited for:</strong> Section titles that divide content into different major areas or topics. For example, in an article, each major section might start with an `<h2>` to give a clear overview of the key sections.</p>

    <h3>This is an H3 Heading</h3>
    <p><strong>Best suited for:</strong> Subsections under the `<h2>` heading. It could be used for a breakdown of ideas or steps within a section. In a tutorial, for example, each step might use an `<h3>` heading.</p>

    <h4>This is an H4 Heading</h4>
    <p><strong>Best suited for:</strong> Less prominent subsections. It is often used for smaller divisions within a section where `<h3>` headings have been used, like defining a particular concept or term in detail.</p>

    <h5>This is an H5 Heading</h5>
    <p><strong>Best suited for:</strong> Even smaller subsections, such as a detailed explanation or supplementary information that doesn't require much attention but still needs its own title.</p>

    <h6>This is an H6 Heading</h6>
    <p><strong>Best suited for:</strong> The smallest heading level, used for minor notes or additional details at the very bottom of a hierarchy. Itâ€™s ideal for fine print or less important information.</p>

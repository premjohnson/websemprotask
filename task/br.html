    <h1>This is an H1 Heading</h1>
    <p><strong>Best suited for:</strong> The <b>main title</b> of the webpage, such as the <i>name of a blog</i>, article, or webpage topic. Use this sparingly, as there should typically only be <b>one</b> `<h1>` per page for the <i>most important title</i>.</p>

    <h2>This is an H2 Heading</h2>
    <p><strong>Best suited for:</strong> <b>Section titles</b> that divide content into different major areas or topics. For example, in an article, each major section might start with an `<h2>` to give a <i>clear overview</i> of the key sections.</p>

    <h3>This is an H3 Heading</h3>
    <p><strong>Best suited for:</strong> <i>Subsections</i> under the `<h2>` heading. It could be used for a <b>breakdown of ideas</b> or steps within a section. In a tutorial, for example, each <i>step</i> might use an `<h3>` heading.</p>

    <h4>This is an H4 Heading</h4>
    <p><strong>Best suited for:</strong> <b>Less prominent subsections</b>. It is often used for <i>smaller divisions</i> within a section where `<h3>` headings have been used, like defining a particular <b>concept</b> or <i>term</i> in detail.</p>

    <h5>This is an H5 Heading</h5>
    <p><strong>Best suited for:</strong> Even <i>smaller subsections</i>, such as a detailed <b>explanation</b> or <i>supplementary information</i> that doesn't require much attention but still needs its own title.</p>

    <h6>This is an H6 Heading</h6>
    <p><strong>Best suited for:</strong> The <b>smallest heading</b> level, used for <i>minor notes</i> or additional details at the very bottom of a hierarchy. Itâ€™s ideal for <b>fine print</b> or less <i>important information</i>.</p>

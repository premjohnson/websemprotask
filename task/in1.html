        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides the structure for web content by using a system of tags and attributes. These elements define the layout, design, and formatting of a webpage. HTML is a foundational technology for the web, along with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.

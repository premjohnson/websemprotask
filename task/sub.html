    <h1>Superscript and Subscript Example</h1>
    <p>In chemistry, the molecular formula for water is represented as H<sub>2</sub>O. This indicates that each molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms (H<sub>2</sub>) and one oxygen atom (O). Additionally, the pH level of a solution can be expressed as a negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration, often noted as pH = -log[H<sub>+</sub>]. In this expression, H<sup>+</sup> represents the hydrogen ion in its ionic form.</p>
